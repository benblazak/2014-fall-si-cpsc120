### Planned

- Week 03 (Friday, September 12)
    - Questions
    - Stages of Compilation (discussion)
    - Variables, Basic Operators, and Assignment
    - Program design (group exercise, if there's time)

### Past

- Week 03 (Wednesday, September 10)
    - Review lecture materials
    - Discuss some of the reasoning behind the way computers are designed
    - Help each other set up programming environments on personal computers
    - Anything else that comes up

  Note that any of these things could easily take up the full hour, so we'll
  have to focus on whatever the most people want.  We'll decide on a game plan
  at the beginning of the session, after introductions and such.
