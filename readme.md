# CPSC 120 SI

A place for helpful links, review materials, and whatever else we come up with.


## Calendar

The CSUF Academic Calendar (for holidays and such) can be found [here] (TODO),
or subscribed to using [this link] (TODO).  The finals schedule can be found
[here] (TODO).

### Planned

- Week 01 (Friday)
    - Review lecture materials
    - Discuss some of the reasoning behind the way computers are designed
    - Help each other set up programming environments on personal computers
    - Anything else that comes up

  Note that any of these things could easily take up the full hour, so we'll
  have to focus on whatever the most people want.  We'll decide on a game plan
  at the beginning of the session, after introductions and such.
